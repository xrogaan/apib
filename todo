 -combatmoves::
    *) list all body parts (DONE at least partially)
    *) a function must determinate if the user successfully hit the bot, given
       the bodypart targeted.
    *) if no bodypart is targeted (or not recognized), the bot check itself
       through random numbers (possibility of double critical and a painful
       death!!)
    *) write all functions to handle actions:
        *) kicks
        *) punch
        *) bit
        *) heatbutt
        *) let me know others basics moves
    *) each attack received has a random power until a user character is created
    *) if the bot should be able to handle an attack but can't process it, it
       output a standard sentence like "i'm a dumbass"

MINOR:

 * (auto) transform long urls into bitly tiny urls
